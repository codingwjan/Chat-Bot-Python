# Python Chatbot with Natural Language Processing and AI

This is the code for the "Python Chatbot with Natural Language Processing and AI" tutorial series on the **Coding with Jan** YouTube channel. In this tutorial series, you'll learn how to build a chatbot using Python and natural language processing techniques. 

## How to Use the Code

The code is organised into several files. The `chatbot.py` file contains the main code for the chatbot. The `patterns.txt` file contains a dictionary of patterns and their corresponding responses, which the chatbot uses to generate responses to user input.

To run the chatbot, simply run the `main.py` file. The chatbot will start listening for user input and generate responses based on the patterns defined in `patterns.txt`.


## Code

You can find the complete code for all parts of this tutorial series in the `Code` directory.
